# Odin Recipes

This is my first project for [The Odin Project].
It is a simple recipe website built using only **HTML** to practice the basics of web development.

## Project Overview
The project will include a main index page and links to a few recipes.  
Each recipe will be a separate HTML page that contains a title, an image, a description, and 

step-by-step instructions.

## Skills Demonstrated
By the end of this project, I will have practiced and demonstrated the following skills:
- Creating and structuring HTML pages
- Using headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links
- Setting up a Git repository and making commits
- Pushing code to GitHub using SSH
- Writing a clear project README

## Reflection
This project is a way to get comfortable with the workflow of writing code, saving it with Git, and sharing it on GitHub.  
At the end, I can come back to this README and update it with what I learned along the way.
